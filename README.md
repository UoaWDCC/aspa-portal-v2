The Auckland Student Pool Association (ASPA), based at the University of Auckland, focuses on facilitating a supportive environment that brings people together who are passionate about pool and aims to promote billiard sports. We hold casual events, coaching events, and tournaments, connecting members that are interested in playing against other members in a competitive and social environment.
